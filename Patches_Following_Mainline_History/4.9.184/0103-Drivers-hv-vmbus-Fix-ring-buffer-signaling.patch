Subject: Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix ring buffer signaling
Reply-To: joseph.salisbury@microsoft.com

Fix bugs in signaling the Hyper-V host when freeing space in the
host->guest ring buffer:

1. The interrupt_mask must not be used to determine whether to signal
   on the host->guest ring buffer
2. The ring buffer write_index must be read (via hv_get_bytes_to_write)
   *after* pending_send_sz is read in order to avoid a race condition
3. Comparisons with pending_send_sz must treat the "equals" case as
   not-enough-space
4. Don't signal if the pending_send_sz feature is not present. Older
   versions of Hyper-V that don't implement this feature will poll.

Fixes: 03bad714a161 ("vmbus: more host signalling avoidance")
